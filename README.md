# Clustering Interval-Censored Data for Disease Phenotyping 

This code contains experiments for "Clustering Interval-Censored Data for Disease Phenotyping" (AAAI 2022). Code references two clinical datasets: 1) Parkinson's disease from the publically available [Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative](https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/download-data) and a heart failure collected from Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center. 

Code is released for the purposes of transparency and replication. If there are any questions with the code, please contact Irene Chen at iychen@csail.mit.edu.
